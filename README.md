# Spaceship Game
I do not claim any code ownership, this code is following along a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2wAo2qwCxGDp9fzBOTy_kpUTSwM1iWWd),
that can be found on the [Bevy Docs](https://bevyengine.org/assets/#learning). In order for me to get a grasp on the basics of the engine to use later.

Also worth mentioning that the assets within the project are downloaded from [poly.pizza](https://poly.pizza/bundle/Ultimate-Space-Kit-YWh743lqGX); With the official notice:
